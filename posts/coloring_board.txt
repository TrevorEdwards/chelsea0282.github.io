For ECE 3140 final project, we used FRDM microcontroller and TFT Display to create an 
accelerometer based coloring board. We laser cut acrylic to build housing so that it is 
easy to hold for users and also attached the batteries so that the uses can use the 
coloring board witout having external connections.
